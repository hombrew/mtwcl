## Single source of truth

When I arrived at Latam Airlines, each team had its own implementation of everything. This wasn't going to work

So I created the first versions of a unified component library that made our work a lot easier at the time. After taking the time to document it, other teams started using it, and even contributed to it. Some time later, it was decided we were in need of a team fully committed to maintaining and improving the project; today it's a fundamental piece in the company's frontend development.
