## Typescript to the rescue

In the past, there was a payment-page project which was developed without knowing all the needs of the business, and of course, eventually, these needs exceeded the capabilities of said project.

At Latam's request, the page had to be in a single repository; The challenge was to make the different combinations of flows/user-types/payment-types/customer-location/etc work harmoniously, since for the same purchase steps, the same information is not shown according to what the customer is looking to do.

**I proposed bringing typescript to Latam with a small POC** (oh boy, do I love POCs). It was believed that it was not feasible due to lack of personnel or time to train them, however they allowed us to redo the payment page with TS for the pain we had. 

Here I designed, led and contributed to said artifact, which today allows the easy integration of each of these aforementioned combinations, such that none could affect the other. We reduced the number of errors by 48% and the conversion increased by 13%.

Seeing the impact, it was decided in the company that new projects are now only being done in typescript, and plans are being made to migrate previous ones.
