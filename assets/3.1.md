## One app to rule them all

One of the monetary incomes from my previous job was selling netflix-like apps. Making an app for a new client was tedious, repetitive and slow work

So I made a POC, the idea was simple: the html and css were created with specific names, and then the project transformed them, added pre-established functionalities on top and generated the apps in React and React Native. Project development times went from 3-4 months to 5-7 days!! Some examples
