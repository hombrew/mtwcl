First of all, the projects mentioned seem incredible to me. *Tailwind just keeps improving.*

Also, other projects occur to me:

- Official tailwind support for React Native/Native Script/Flutter etc.
- Figma plugin to generate Vue, React, React native, etc. components with tailwind.
- Headless-ui shadow-dom support.
- V0-like app with Tailwind ui.

to name a few 💪🏽
