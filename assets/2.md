Maybe I fell in love with computers when my dad taught me how to use them back when I was about 3 years old. I Remember us back then having minesweeper competitions ðŸ’£ðŸ’¥.

When I was little I already assembled and disassembled computers, and after some time, it was dad who started asking me how to use them; which eventually led me to study Electronic Engineering. I really wanted to understand what they had inside.

During my degree I discovered that what I enjoyed the most was programming, so I decided to continue my adventure down this path, and since the web was booming (I think it still is), I decided to start there.

Within my first experiences I worked with PHP, setting up LAMP servers; Python but I didn't understand how to make it work on a server (PHP made it too easy) and Javascript for the front. Shortly after, I discovered jQuery and in my first job I worked with these technologies, Wordpress and at some point Angular.

Until React arrived.

React dethroned everything I knew, it was very easy to reuse and extend. And as a library it did not stop growing. I fell in love. It encouraged me to continue learning more and more.

I recall the debates between Angular and React that dominated online discussions.
